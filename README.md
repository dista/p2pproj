research flash p2p

* establish two-way connection using NetConnection and NetStream
* handle peer leave(User close browser tag, etc), server may not detect this event, so maybe timeout is a good way to handle these situation
* test browser behavior
* **NOT** involve best P2P agrithem used in current network enviroment and video live/vod streaming, this will be involved in our real product. We just the use the most simple agrithem to demo flash's p2p capability
